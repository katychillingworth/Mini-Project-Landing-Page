            <h2>Pet Visits</h2>
            <p>
                Home visits are 20-minute visits that are suitable for feeding, garden breaks, playtime, cuddles for puppies, checking on elderly pets, and anything else which is required to keep your pets happy in your absence. Home visits and pet sitting is not just for dogs. We can help with a wide range of other domestic animals including cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, and more.

            <h2>House Sitting</h2>
            <p>
                Pet sitting involves staying in your house for a longer amount of time to maintain the normal routine your pets have grown to expect. Pet sitting can extend to overnight stays in the owner’s home. A huge benefit to having a house sitter is the lack of disruption this causes for your pets, keeping them in a place they are familiar with while you are not around.

            <h2>Dog Walking</h2>
            <p>
                Regularly walking your dog is important. It dramatically improves their behaviour and health. Dogs need a routine and regular walking should be a part of this. Being able to stretch their legs, explore new environments, and play with varied dogs keeps both their physical and mental health in check.
